not much to say. interested in economics and working with data. run my own [server](https://luna.ovh) (which this site is hosted on) and self-host certain applications. play rpgs, work on music arrangements and read slice-of-life manga.

pretty clumsy at nearly everything i do. getting things done is more important than doing things right. i used to be a perfectionist, but have forced myself to focus on actually finishing something rather than taking an awful lot of time making sure it's perfect.
