Not much to say, honestly. Interested in economics and working with data. Run my own [server](https://yellow.luna.ovh/posts/server/) and host certain applications (this site happens to be one of those).

Pretty clumsy at nearly everything I do. I feel that getting things done is more important than doing things right; finding a balance between quality and quantity is tricky though.

Online handle based on [Yellow](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Yellow_(Adventures) ) from [Pok√©mon Adventures](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures). Hardly original, but I guess it'll do. The 404 part is from the most frustrating (imo) error when you find a broken link.
