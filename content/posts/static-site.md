this site is a collection of HTML files generated from markdown using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). theme adapted from [hugo-theme-console](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console). repo available [here](https://github.com/yellow404/yellow.luna.ovh).

it's easy to get started with markdown and static sites are easy to deploy, so i'd highly recommend using a static site when possible (lower bandwidth requirements translates to higher speed and responsiveness).

deploying static sites using [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) et al. is straightforward and thus usually recommended. however, i've hosted this site on my personal [server](https://luna.ovh/) that runs other applications as well for flexibility and extensibility.
