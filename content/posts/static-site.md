This site is a collection of HTML files generated from Markdown using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) framework.

Markdown is fairly simple to use. Combine that with the ease of deploying static websites (and increased performance), and it's hard to not recommend using a static site when possible, ideally through [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) or a similar service. These services have a global CDN and provide one-click hosting, straight from your Git repo. Having said that, I'm currently hosting this site on my [personal server](https://yellow.luna.ovh/posts/server.md), for flexibility and extensibility.

The theme was adapted from [hugo-theme-console](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console). The repo for the website itself can be found [here](https://github.com/yellow404/yellow.luna.ovh).
